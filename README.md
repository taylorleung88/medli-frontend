Front-End Code to Medli

Medli Music is a project that uses the Spotify API. It allows users to create parties and users can add songs to a party's playlist. Due to the project being monotized, only the front-end code (written by me) can be shared on GitHub. The web application does not have a built-in media player or capability to create a party because the focus was on funneling users to use mobile applications. Though the back-end code is not visible, below you can find a quick demo of front-end capabilities:
